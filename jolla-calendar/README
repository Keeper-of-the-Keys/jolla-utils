What is this patch?
-------------------
This patch makes jolla-calendar respect the local first day of the week.

It has been tested with the following locales: 
   en_GB (monday)
   nl_NL (monday)
   he_IL (sunday)
   ar_KW (saturday)

Setting the locale
------------------
To actually switch your locale for the needs of jolla-calender it is enough to 
set the LC_TIME environment variable in /var/lib/environment/nemo/locale.conf

I have not provided a GUI way to change this and the above file will be 
overwritten when you change the language/localization settings on your phone,
when LC_TIME is not set LC_ALL or LANG will be used, so if your language is set 
to the time locale you want you don't need to make this setting.

LICENCE
-------
All sources are considered 'propriatary' by jolla (meaning they don't officially 
accept patches) but carry BSD headers, I do not wish to change the license in 
any way so that Jolla can hopefully include my patch, mention of my name in the 
source will be appreciated :).
